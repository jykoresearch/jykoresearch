🎓 BSc in Architectural Engineering at Hanyang University, South Korea | *Summa Cum Laude*

#### 🔭 My PhD research focuses on:
* (i) to demonstrate the importance of the causal lens in developing occupant-centric building control solutions.
* (ii) to apply data-driven causal learning approaches to model human-building interactions.
* (iii) to develop and propose an occupant-interactive thermostat and building systems that can learn occupant behaviors in a more efficient and reliable way.

### 🛠️ I have expertise in:
