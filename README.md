# Hey,
### My name is Jinyoung Ko. I study Human-Building Interaction through the lens of causality.

ðŸŒ± I am a PhD student in Civil Engineering (Building Science) at the University of Toronto, working in the Intelligent and Interactive Buildings Lab (advisor: [Dr. Seungjae Lee](https://hab.civmin.utoronto.ca/people/dr-seungjae-lee/)). I hold a Master of Science in Architectural Engineering from Hanyang University, where I studied under [Dr. Jae-Weon Jeong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9o_3FZ4AAAAJ&hl=ko&oi=ao/), and earned my Bachelorâ€™s degree *Summa Cum Laude* in Architectural Engineering from the same university.

Currently, I focus on:
- Developing occupant-centric building solutions through the lens of causality.
- Applying causal machine learning approaches to model human-building interactions.
- Conducting causal reasoning with occupant data from full observations and semi-controlled experiments.

If youâ€™re interested in my work, please take a look at my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11gRWusAPum5zXh4VHKVGbVvyxIKVRtqB/view?usp=drive_link).
